# Sweet Potato Research
This is a repository of my research on the economic impact of sweet potatoes in the region of Presidente Prudente, Brazil. I mainly used R and Excel to transform and calculate the data. Due to some limitations, the code is messy and likely requires some work. However, the documents (in Portuguese) that was made based on the code are available here.
